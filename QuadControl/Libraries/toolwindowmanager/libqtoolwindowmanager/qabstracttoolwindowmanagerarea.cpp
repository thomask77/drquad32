    \class QAbstractToolWindowManagerArea

    \brief The QAbstractToolWindowManagerArea class is the base class for widgets
    used by QToolWindowManager to display one or several tool windows in its layout
    or floating windows.

    To customize appearance and behavior of areas, subclass QAbstractToolWindowManagerArea
    and implement its virtual functions. Also subclass QToolWindowManager and reimplement
    QToolWindowManager::createArea to return new object of created subclass.

    A subclass of QAbstractToolWindowManagerArea should implement displaying one or multiple
    tool windows, ability to switch between them, drag one tool window or entire area out of
    its place using mouse.

    \inmodule QtWidgets

    \since 5.4

 */
/*!
    \fn QAbstractToolWindowManagerArea::toolWindows() const

    Implement this function to return list of tool windows in this area in actual order.
 */
/*!
    \fn QAbstractToolWindowManagerArea::activateToolWindow(QWidget *toolWindow)

    Implement this function to activate (show, raise) \a toolWindow in the area. \a toolWindow
    must be a member of the area.
 */
/*!
    \fn QAbstractToolWindowManagerArea::addToolWindows(const QWidgetList &toolWindows)

    Implement this function to add \a toolWindows to the area. The area may become a parent
    of tool windows to display them. \a toolWindows should appear
    in the end of QAbstractToolWindowManagerArea::toolWindows list immediately after this action.
    However if the area implementation provides a way to change tool windows order and user has
    changed it, QAbstractToolWindowManagerArea::toolWindow order should change accordingly.
 */
/*!
    \fn QAbstractToolWindowManagerArea::removeToolWindow(QWidget *toolWindow)

    Implement this function to remove \a toolWindow from the area. Ownership and visibility
    of \a toolWindow should not be changed, as it's a responsibility of the manager to adjust them.
